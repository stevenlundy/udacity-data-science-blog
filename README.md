# Udacity Data Science - Trick Taking Card Game Data Analysis

## Motivation

A trick-taking game is a card game in which players take turns playing cards and the highest card played each round wins the trick. There is often a trump suit that beats all other suits, and players must follow suit if possible.

In this project I ask which parts of a hand of the trick-taking card game are most predictive of the outcome of the hand.
1. Is having more trump cards most predictive of winning tricks?
1. Is having more high cards most predictive of winning tricks?
1. Is having more cards with the same suit most predictive of winning tricks?
1. Is being the leading player in the round a good predictor of winning tricks?
