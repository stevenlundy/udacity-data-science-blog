    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A trick-taking game is a card game in which players take turns playing cards and the highest card played each round wins the trick. There is often a trump suit that beats all other suits, and players must follow suit if possible. The game is played over a series of rounds, with each round consisting of a number of tricks. The player or team that wins the most tricks wins the game. There are many different trick-taking games, but they all share some common elements. The most common trick-taking games are Bridge, Whist, Hearts, and Spades.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this project, I'll be looking at simulated data from one round of a trick-taking game. The data was generated using a simple trick-taking game with the following rules:\n",
    "- The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.\n",
    "- There are four players, each of whom is dealt 8 cards.\n",
    "- There is a trump suit dealt randomly at the beginning of the round.\n",
    " \n",
    "The data consists of the number information about each players hands (number of high cards (J,Q,K,A), number of low cards (2,3,4,5), percent of trump cards, suit impurity, if the player was leading the round, and how many tricks they won). The goal is to predict the number of tricks each player will win in the round."
